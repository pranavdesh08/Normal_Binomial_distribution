# Normal_Binomial_distribution

Contains Gaussian and Binomial distribution package.

This package can be downloaded using pip install Normal-Binomial-dist.

Calculates the mean, standard deviation of the data.

Calculates the probability distribution function of Gaussian and Binomial distributions.

Plots histogram and bar charts for the data.

# How to use the package:

The Generaldistribution.py contains the Distribution class with method to read data and set mean and standard deviation.

Gaussiandistribution.py and Binomialdistribution uses parent class to read data and has methods to calculate mean, stdev and plot the data.

test.py is the test script for the Gaussiandistribution.py and Binomialdistribution code.

Setup.py has the settings for uploading package to pypi.org.

numbers.txt and numbers_binomial.txt are the sample data files.
